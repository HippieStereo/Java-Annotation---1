Creating a Custom Annotation in Java

https://www.baeldung.com/java-custom-annotation

Three custom annotations with the goal of serializing an object into a JSON string :

- First one on the class level, to indicate to the compiler that our object can be serialized.
- Second one to the fields that we want to include in the JSON string.
- Third annotation on the method level, to specify the method that we'll use to initialize our object.
